      <h2>about.</h2>
      <p>
        if I have to be honest with you, i've never found intros easy—like how do i
        capture the whole essence of my being in a few words? But let's see how i
        fare out.
        <br />
        i write PRDs for a living, work out for mental health, read books for
        sanity, and click pictures for fun. boring? maybe.
      </p>
      <p>for the last 8 months, I’ve been helping grow my mother’s small business, Neerakriti, an artisanal Indian home decor brand. I’m doing this in my part time and helping her set up things from scratch. the thrill of 0 → 1!!</p>    </section>

      <p>
        i've been in product for ~4 years now, straight out of college and have
        worked in startups and enterprises across healthcare, fintech (trading),
        and now in the web hosting space.
      </p>
      <p>
        i enjoy the generalist nature of my work – helps me navigate chaos, although in the initial years, it was a bit
        daunting. i have a background in CSE and as part of my bachelor’s curriculum, we were expected to do a semester
        as an internship – that’s when i stumbled upon Proactive, and i haven’t looked back since.

      <p>now i happen to be a woman of multiple interests, so bear with me in this section <i>rolls up her sleeves</i> some of them are more seasoned and i’ve been at them for a while, some are more recent and possibly an outcome of living away from friends and family. i’ve been away from home for about 3 years and its taught me a few things. so after some navigation, i’ve expanded my interests. they now include exercising regularly, trying to perfect my mum’s chicken curry recipe and the occasional binge watching.<br> <br> below are some of my more long-standing interests- <br></p>
