                music has always been very very dear to me. music is the language of the soul. my parents had a rich
                influence
                on my music taste so i grew up listening to bryan adams, the carpenters, eric clapton, vengaboys, rd
                burman and
                kishore kumar. i’m not a singer and i once tried to learn drums (my favorite instrument) in uni but then
                covid struck :(
            </p>

                however, my spotify is a digital footprint that i’m proud of. you can check out my playlists on spotify.
