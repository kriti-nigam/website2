            this is a funny one! this wasn’t one of those things I discovered as a
            child or even aspired to do. but one day, it just clicked (pun intended).

            i was a fresher in college and had a very cheap phone with a very low
            quality camera, I think it was a redmi 4A. but our college blessed us
            with some of the best sunsets and I would instinctively, take my phone
            out to capture a glimpse of it, always knowing I would never do justice
            to the reality.
          </p>

            but I enjoyed it a lot - like it brought me a sense of joy very
            inexplicable and very genuine in nature. soon after, I also started
            editing my pictures on vsco and that hasn’t stopped. i haven’t taken this
            seriously - all pictures i’ve clicked are things i’ve liked witnessing
            with my eyes.
          </p>

            i’ve largely captured pictures with my phone (s) and only recently was
            gifted a 35mm. below is a link to my vsco.
