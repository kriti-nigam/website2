        i was an avid reader, inculcated this habit in my schooldays. i used to be
        the kid that read on the bus ride to & from school; i was that dedicated.
        but unfortunately, i didn’t keep at it and eventually paused reading for a
        bit around 12th grade well into my college years. i picked it up back again
        during covid but wasn’t very committed to it. but then i rekindled this old
        flame, so as a promise to myself, i consciously committed to it last year
        and have been very regular at it. i owe a large part of re-building this
        habit to blossoms, a very old bookstore in bangalore.
      </p>
      <p>
        as part of that commitment, i’ve been tracking the books i’m reading. next
        thing to do would be to draft book summaries, reviews. oh also, i started a
        bookclub at IG - although it turned out to be a safe space to talk about
        work, mental health, lifestyle, entrepreneurship, parenting for my
        colleagues, but that’s okay :)
