        <p>
            <p>
                With the sun setting behind us and city lights below us,<br>
                The air around me grew dense as it mixed<br>
                With your lust as you blew out that last puff.<br>
                My breathing grew heavy as my vision got blurry<br>
                Fixated on you as you stood up and leaned in closer<br>
                You knew, didn’t you?<br><br>

                When our lips brushed against each other,<br>
                The unfathomed distance between us floated by<br>
                Fading far away from the chains of reality<br>
                That broke with each stride you took towards me.<br>
                You knew, didn’t you?<br><br>

                Your hands ran down my body<br>
                Claiming their trophy, my body your prize<br>
                My heart, your prisoner.<br>
                But long before your touch, your gaze<br>
                Had already corrupted its way inside my breast.<br>
                But you knew, didn’t you?<br><br>

                As your tongue tasted mine<br>
                It grew a liking to that warmth.<br>
                That warmth fuelled by my pain and your fears<br>
                Soon plummeted into a fire<br>
                Now burning with your pain and my fears.<br>
                But you knew, didn’t you?<br><br>

                You knew this fire wouldn’t extinguish<br>
                Yet you kept it burning<br>
                With the same old fears, the same old tears.<br>
                Only to be tamed by our agony and misery<br>
                But you left, leaving me with my burning carcass<br>
                Because you knew, didn’t you?<br><br>
                
                My burning body still covered in our debris.<br>
                They told me to hate you but how could I?<br>
                When the only love I had known was to hate myself<br>
                I knew I pushed you away, as my unfounded wrath<br>
                Became the keys to your getaway car.
