    <section class="poetry-content">
      <p>With the sun setting behind us and city lights below us,
The air around me grew dense as it mixed
With your lust as you blew out that last puff.
My breathing grew heavy as my vision got blurry
Fixated on you as you stood up and leaned in closer
You knew, didn't you?

When our lips brushed against each other,
The unfathomed distance between us floated by
Fading far away from the chains of reality
That broke with each stride you took towards me.
You knew, didn't you?

Your hands ran down my body
Claiming their trophy, my body your prize
My heart, your prisoner.
But long before your touch, your gaze
Had already corrupted its way inside my breast.
But you knew, didn't you?

As your tongue tasted mine
It grew a liking to that warmth.
That warmth fuelled by my pain and your fears
Soon plummeted into a fire
Now burning with your pain and my fears.
But you knew, didn't you?

You knew this fire wouldn't extinguish
Yet you kept it burning
With the same old fears, the same old tears.
Only to be tamed by our agony and misery
But you left, leaving me with my burning carcass
Because you knew, didn't you?

My burning body still covered in our debris.
They told me to hate you but how could I?
When the only love I had known was to hate myself
I knew I pushed you away, as my unfounded wrath
Became the keys to your getaway car.</p>
