        <p>
            In the recess of vanilla twilight, the warmth of <br>
            <br>
            Honesty. The soft folds of her skin against <br>
            his shaggy beard. The glimpse of a peaceful, <br>
            <br>
            snoring face in the matrix of chaos. Unwinding <br>
            <br>
            to Porcupine Tree and semi-burned pancakes <br>
            <br>
            making a jester of time, time mingled with <br>
            <br>
            two hearts and unseeming innocent <br>
            <br>
            laughters, laughters that dissolved into <br>
            <br>
            kisses like the dawn breaks into <br>
            <br>
            the day, days seemed infinite until <br>
            <br>
            the night took over, nights spent pondering <br>
            <br>
            the delicate details of his beautiful face; <br>
            <br>
            the razor cuts, the botched pimples, <br>
            <br>
            the mysterious marks, the chewed nails <br>
            <br>
            all seemed to flow <br>
            <br>
            into perfect harmony like Bachâ€™s symphony <br>
            <br>
            breakfasts that lasted till noon, and the break <br>
            <br>
            of sunlight was unbidden by these two nascent <br>
            <br>
            souls, who found their recuse from life <br>
            <br>
            in each other. Head massages with the breath <br>
            <br>
            of freshly bloomed flowers as they sat <br>
            <br>
            and gazed at the inebriating sunsets, <br>
            <br>
            catching a breath as the other made <br>
            <br>
            a silly excuse to spend more time, <br>
            <br>
            time was an outlaw, uniting <br>
            <br>
            and separating them. <br>
            <br>
            each lay their life bare; <br>
            <br>
            childhood stories to traumatic teen <br>
            <br>
            she thought she got closer <br>
            <br>
            to that canvas of incomplete picture <br>
            <br>
            as she nibbled on the chocolate cookie <br>
            <br>
            while he narrated tales from his travels; <br>
            <br>
            long and far and played his hearty guitar; <br>
            <br>
            elated as he sang his dearest songs <br>
            <br>
            They built that dream together <br>
            <br>
            Unhindered by the flaws in each other <br>
            <br>
            That dream, a requiem of their love <br>
            <br>
            That dream, an epitaph of their love.
