            In the recess of vanilla twilight, the warmth of

Honesty. The soft folds of her skin against

his shaggy beard. The glimpse of a peaceful,

snoring face in the matrix of chaos. Unwinding

to Porcupine Tree and semi-burned pancakes

making a jester of time, time mingled with

two hearts and unseeming innocent

laughters, laughters that dissolved into

kisses like the dawn breaks into

the day, days seemed infinite until

the night took over, nights spent pondering

the delicate details of his beautiful face;

the razor cuts, the botched pimples,

the mysterious marks, the chewed nails

all seemed to flow

into perfect harmony like Bachâ€™s symphony

breakfasts that lasted till noon, and the break

of sunlight was unbidden by these two nascent

souls, who found their recuse from life

in each other. Head massages with the breath

of freshly bloomed flowers as they sat

and gazed at the inebriating sunsets,

catching a breath as the other made

a silly excuse to spend more time,

time was an outlaw, uniting

and separating them.

each lay their life bare;

childhood stories to traumatic teen

she thought she got closer

to that canvas of incomplete picture

as she nibbled on the chocolate cookie

while he narrated tales from his travels;

long and far and played his hearty guitar;

elated as he sang his dearest songs

They built that dream together

Unhindered by the flaws in each other

That dream, a requiem of their love

That dream, an epitaph of their love. </p>
