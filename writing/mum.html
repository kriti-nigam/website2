                Even as I tried to write about you today, I couldn’t<br>
                Because how can I? writing is cathartic for me, and ever since you’ve been gone<br>
                I have shied away from my writing pad knowing fully well what follows.<br>
                The unsung tears, the drowning helplessness, the wallowing shivers<br>
                To write about you would mean to face my deepest fears, my bitterest shortcomings<br>
                The things I’m rather fond of putting away, like the clothes in the back of my closet<br>
                Ah! No one to tell me when to fix my wardrobe<br>
                because this is something only you could make me do<br>
                they ask me how am I doing, and with the utmost sanity I can gather,<br>
                I sabotage my thoughts with jokes because I hate sympathy. And not that anyone<br>
                Can say anything that will make you come back to us.<br>
                But you were like sunshine, warm and mellow, significant and unnoticed<br>
                Essential for my survival, and much like any plant;<br>
                Oh I double water the plants you left behind as homage to your presence,<br>
                You nurtured me and made me into the person I am today.<br>
                But I could never say this you while you were still here mom,<br>
                Still cannot, and that’s the irony of this ink<br>
                You know I cannot express openly, you know how to look<br>
                Beyond my sarcasm and jokes. You made my flaws tangible because<br>
                You weren’t afraid to admit that you were broken too. You were infinite-<br>
                In patience, in your wisdom, in your words and in your thoughts<br>
                I knew you were different mom. You understood my anger.<br><br>
                
                And while everyone is trying to compensate for your vacant space<br>
                The kitchen still yearns to dance to your rhythm. The drawing room<br>
                misses its evening tea accompanied by gossip and my college rants<br>
                In a desperate bid to prolong your retreating presence,<br>
                I put on your favorite perfume, and wear your lipstick<br>
                Hoping that the day I have to drape a saree, you’ll be there.<br>
                No you’re not perfect, but you never backed down<br>
                I cannot quantify your significance in my life<br>
                It is amplified every day, every hour, every moment<br>
                In everything you do and don’t, in your absence and presence<br>
                And in the dingy corners of my heart that have hated and loved you.<br>
                
            </p>
